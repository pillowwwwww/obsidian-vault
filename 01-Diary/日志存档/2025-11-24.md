## Tracking

I sincerely thank the authors for the comprehensive and rigorous rebuttal, particularly for providing the requested quantitative evidence in Tables A, B, and C. The spectral analysis (Tables A & B) convincingly supports the hypothesis that non-smooth activations bias the network towards higher frequencies, consistent with signal processing theory.

However, regarding Table C, this evidence unequivocally demonstrates that the adoption of the large $7 \times 7$ kernel is the primary driver of performance, contributing approximately 82% of the total gain ($6.3\% / 7.7\%$). The Gating Mechanism and the Frequency View—the elements emphasized in the paper's title and abstract—only provide a marginal refinement.

While the synergy between the large kernel (to build the base features) and the frequency-aware gate (to refine them) is valuable, the paper's current framing is misleading. Positioning the paper as "Revisiting Gating Mechanisms From A Frequency View" when the $7 \times 7$ kernel is the workhorse constitutes overclaiming and misattribution of the core contribution. This is an issue of scientific integrity and accurate credit.

Given the strong final empirical results and the detailed analysis provided, I will maintain my initial rating of 6.
